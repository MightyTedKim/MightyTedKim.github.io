# Hansae 
(2016.11.07 ~ 2015.05.04)  / Sales Department

I've been working at an Apparel Vendor 'Hansae'  for 6 months. Managed product development to shipping. Communicated with Buyer Walmart in US, factories in Nicaragua/Vietnam.



Tired of doing works which repeated, looked for ways that would improve the efficiency. Studied Excel and soon found out the presence of VBA and Python. 



Below are the works that I improved after leaving the company. Asking for data and organizing it with program language R.
